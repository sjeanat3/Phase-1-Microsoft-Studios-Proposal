# Microsoft Movie Studios: Business Strategy Proposal

## Overview

This project seeks to recommend Microsoft a business strategy related to launching a movie production studio. Due to the lack of Microsoft's industry knowledge, the below data analysis will interpret the available data to recommend movie genres to invest in as well as target budgets and return on investments. Microsoft will be able to use this analysis to identify the necessary investment strategies to apply to their first productions.

## Business Problem

Microsoft's business problem largely involves entering the large, global industry of film and lack of experience in the movie production industry. Although Microsoft itself is a substantial firm with numerous resources, the film industry has numerous barriers of industry heavily dependent on industry experience and scale. Microsoft currently offers rental movies on its site for customers but has never produced a film. It is crucial for Microsoft to selectively choose what films to produce as this could make or break the program.

## Data

This project utilizes IMDB's data set which provides for movie genres,  Box Office Mojo's data set (powered by IMDB Pro) which provides production studio data, and The Numbers data set which gives access to worldwide gross sales data and release years.

## Methods

This project uses quantitative and visual analyses including (i) identifying the top preforming production studios by production volume and median ROI, (ii) the top three most popular movie genres produced by these production studios, and (iii) the target budget size and return on investment.



## Results

The top five performing production studios when considering the number of movies the studio produces are Universal, Fox, Warner Brothers, BV (Disney), and Sony.

When considering the top five production studios previously identified, the top three most popular genre interms of production studio investment are Action, Comedy, and Adventure.

When comparing the movie budgets and movie return on investments and group the findings based on production studios and movie genre it's observed that generally Fox and Universal achieve the highest ROIs and that there is no clear linear relationship between movie budget and ROI.

## Conclusions

This analysis leads to three recommendations for improving operations of Microsoft’s Movie Studios:

- **Consider employing both BV (Disney’s) and Universal Studio’s business and production strategies.** Considering the volume of movies produced and median ROI, Disney and Universal Studio are consistently the front runner of the industry.
- **Mostly invest in action and comedy movies.** Given comedy tends to have a smaller distribution of production budgets and relatively consistently high ROI, Microsoft should produce comedy films as their first few projects. As productions are rolled-out, Microsoft can then produce more action films as these too have relatively higher ROIs but tend to have a wider distribution in terms of project budget.
- **Target low budgets and high ROIs.** Given there is no clear linear correlation related to project budget size and return on investment, Microsoft should consider producing projects with lower budgets (<$100m) as these tend to produce relatively high ROIs (~500%).

### Next Steps

Further analyses could yield additional insights to further inform Microsoft’s movie production strategy:

- **More recent data sets to analyze the most up-to-date movie production trends.** These insights rely upon movies that were released between 2010 and 2018. In order to analyze the most recent movie production projects, a more recent data set representing films released during 2019 or after could result in more accurate analyses.
- **More time to analyze which sub-genres are most invested in.** Given the time constraint of this presentation, an analysis of sub-genre investments by top production companies could further assist Microsoft in deciding, for example, which types of comedy films the firm should invest in.
- **Refined calculation of ROI.** The analyses of ROI in this assumes a relatively simple calculation. With a larger data set that include production budget breakdowns and expense line items could result in more accurate ROI representations.
